<p>The idea came from a NetworkChuck video about creating a blog/website that you own based on custom domains that you have purchased. I love this guy&rsquo;s videos, and while some of them are obvious plugs for a service or product, he tries to integrate useful and somewhat meaningful ideas into his content, and that&rsquo;s something I feel YouTube sorely needs.</p>
<p>Regardless of why I&rsquo;m doing this though, it&rsquo;s a test of my capabilities and management for a low cost of just the domain, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to learn something new! The project couldn&rsquo;t be built as quickly as it was without the help of AI/ML as well, a lot of this code was written/edited and troubleshot with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot. I know that&rsquo;s not the same as traditionally learning a skill, but I do feel this is the future of programming, removing a huge barrier of educational entry that allows for more robust and creative content.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the blogging journey I&rsquo;m creating, and welcome to The Inner Circle!</p>
