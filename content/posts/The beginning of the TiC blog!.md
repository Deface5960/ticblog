Here we are, the beginning of my web admin/creation journey, building a nice (albeit very basic) blog for my discord group! This is an extremely early prototype blog and essentially a proof of concept, but I'll be working on this in the future and will hopefully have regular updates whenever I'm available to post.

The idea came from a NetworkChuck video about creating a blog/website that you own based on custom domains that you have purchased. I love this guy's videos, and while some of them are obvious plugs for a service or product, he tries to integrate useful and somewhat meaningful ideas into his content, and that's something I feel YouTube sorely needs.

Regardless of why I'm doing this though, it's a test of my capabilities and management for a low cost of just the domain, and I couldn't be more excited to learn something new! The project couldn't be built as quickly as it was without the help of AI/ML as well, a lot of this code was written/edited and troubleshot with the assistance of Microsoft Copilot. I know that's not the same as traditionally learning a skill, but I do feel this is the future of programming, removing a huge barrier of educational entry that allows for more robust and creative content.

I hope you enjoy the blogging journey I'm creating, and welcome to The Inner Circle!
